# Private Identity Server

- `/client` - Create React App front-end for identity service
- `/server` - Flask private identity server

## Running the Application

Make sure you have `docker` installed on your system.

1. run `docker-compose build`
2. run `docker-compose up`

This will start both the client/server application, and both will reload automatically as you make changes.
